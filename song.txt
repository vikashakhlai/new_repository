We don’t talk anymore.
 We don’t talk anymore.
 We don’t talk anymore
 Like we used to do.
 We don’t laugh anymore.
 What was all of it for?
 Ooh, we don’t talk anymore
 Like we used to do.

I just heard you found the one
You’ve been looking,
You’ve been looking for.
I wish I would have known
That wasn’t me.
‘Cause even after all this time
I still wonder
Why I can’t move on
Just the way you did so easily.

 Don’t wanna know
 What kinda dress
 You’re wearing tonight
 If he’s holding onto you so tight,
 The way I did before.
 I overdosed.
 Shoulda known your love was a game,
 Now I can’t get you out of my brain.
 Ooh, it’s such a shame…
